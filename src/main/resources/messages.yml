# Every message can use the {currentCount}, {totalCount} and {neededPlayers} placeholders to represent the player count
# For join and quit messages, you can use {player} to represent the player that joined/quit
# For death messages, you can use the {victim} and {killer} placeholders to represent the victim and killer
# For deaths that don't involve a killer, only {victim} will be parsed
# {countdown} is used to represent a countdown (E.g. in 5 seconds). {time} will always be parsed as seconds in a countdown message
# For messages that require maps, you can use {map} and {votes} to represent the map and its number of votes
